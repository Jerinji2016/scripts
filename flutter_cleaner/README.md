# flutter_cleaner

Script to clean all flutter project builds

## 🤷 __Why Bother?__  

Mostly we dont clear flutter builds resulting in consuming GBs of space.

***

### 💯 Good to follow

Have a habit of grouping all project of under a single folder, something like `Projects` or `Works`.

***

### 🤝 Working with script

Change the `FOLDER_PATH` within the [script](./flutter_cleaner.sh) to your parent folder containing all Flutter Projects.
